## Minimum unique coverage index

Given an array of integers ```nums```, return the least index value up to which all unique values of the list are covered:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 5, 3, 7, 3, 7, 5, 1]
Output: 3
```
 
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 5, 3, 7, 3, 7, 5, 1, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0]
Output: 13
```
Constraints:
```
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```

Follow-up: 
1. Can you provide the time complexity and space complexity of the solution provided?
2. Can the given solution be optimized (based on the space/time complexities) ?
